                I finally found a solution to do what I want.
                As p a paragraphe and article the wrapper. If you want to
                apply ellipsis to p depending on article height (which also
                depends on window height), you need to get the height of the
                article, the line-height of the p and then
                articleHeight/lineHeight to find the number of line-clamp
                that can be added dynamically then.
